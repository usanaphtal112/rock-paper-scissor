The rock-paper-scissors game is a simple hand game played between two people. The objective of the game is to choose an item that defeats the item chosen by the opponent. Here's how it's played:

The game begins with both players making a hand gesture simultaneously. The gestures represent either a rock, paper, or scissors.

Rock is represented by making a fist with your hand. Paper is represented by extending your hand flat with your palm facing down. Scissors are represented by extending your hand with your index and middle fingers extended and spread apart.

The basic rules of the game are as follows:

Rock beats scissors. (Rock smashes scissors)
Scissors beat paper. (Scissors cut paper)
Paper beats rock. (Paper covers rock)
Once both players have made their hand gestures, they reveal their choices by showing their hands simultaneously.

The winner is determined by the following rules:

If both players choose the same item, it's a tie, and the game is usually played again.
If one player's choice beats the other player's choice based on the rules mentioned above, that player wins the round.
The game is usually played in a best-of-three format, where the first player to win two rounds is declared the overall winner. However, the number of rounds can be adjusted based on the players' preference.
